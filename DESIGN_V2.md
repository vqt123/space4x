# Space4X Design Document v2.0

## Core Vision
A strategic space trading game where exploration, information gathering, and calculated risk define success. Players navigate between distant port clusters, balancing safety and profit in a universe where knowledge is power.

## Universe Structure

### Port Clusters
- **Cluster Size**: ~100 ports per cluster
- **Distribution**: Clusters scattered far apart across the universe
- **Central Hub**: Each cluster has one major trading hub at its center
- **Safe Zone**: ~20 ports around the hub are under police protection
- **Frontier Zones**: Areas beyond police protection offer higher rewards but greater risks

### Hub Features
- Ship dealerships (buy/sell ships)
- Ship upgrade facilities
- Supply markets
- Information brokers
- Bank/credit services (loans available)
- Insurance offices
- Debt collection enforcers

- **Cost**: Moderate
- **Purpose**: Information gathering and exploration

### Trader Ship
- **Speed**: Slow (0.5x base speed)
- **Cargo**: Large (20+ units)

- **Types**: Barren, Fertile, Resource-rich, Hostile
- **Discovery**: Found randomly during exploration scans
- **Coordinates**: Must be recorded for later colonization

## Risk/Reward Zones

### Safe Zone (0-20 units from hub)

- Lower profit margins (10-20%)
- Stable, predictable trading
- New player friendly

### Frontier Zone (20-50 units from hub)
