# Space4X - Development Roadmap & TODO

## Current Status âœ…

- [x] Project setup (React + Vite + Three.js + TypeScript)
- [x] 3D universe with 500 randomly distributed trading ports
- [x] 10 autonomous bots with random movement behavior
- [x] Visual travel lines showing bot destinations
- [x] Camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
- [x] Basic lighting and starfield background
- [x] Trading ports sized correctly (0.5 radius)
- [x] Bots render as orange cones, ports as green spheres
- [x] Player ship implementation (blue cone with distinct appearance)
- [x] Player spawning at random starting port
- [x] Player location tracking and state management
- [x] Navigation algorithm (3 nearest ports finder)
- [x] Game UI with current location display
- [x] Destination selection with distances and travel times
- [x] Travel button functionality for each destination
- [x] Player travel system at 1 unit/second
- [x] Real-time travel progress indicator
- [x] Automatic destination updates on arrival
- [x] Player travel line showing destination
- [x] Center-focused camera system with scroll wheel zoom

## Next Phase: Polish & Improvements ðŸ”§

### Performance & Technical Issues
- [ ] Fix instanced mesh initialization issues for TradingPorts component
- [ ] Consider performance optimization for 500 individual mesh components
- [ ] Fix player movement race condition crash (completed but needs commit)

### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add port names/labels visible in 3D space
- [ ] Improve visual distinction between current port and destinations
- [ ] Add sound effects for travel start/completion
- [ ] Add particle effects or trails for ships

### Code Organization
- [ ] Extract game logic into reusable utilities
- [ ] Separate components into individual files
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Add error boundaries for better crash handling

## Technical Issues to Address ðŸ”§

### Known Problems
- [ ] Fix instanced mesh initialization issues for TradingPorts component
- [ ] Consider performance optimization for 500 individual mesh components

### Code Organization
- [ ] Extract game logic into reusable utilities as complexity grows
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for game entities

## Development Notes

- Player will interact only through UI panels, not by clicking 3D objects
- Maintain same travel speed (1 unit/second) for consistency with bots
- UI should show travel time calculations based on distance
- 3D view serves as visualization only, not interaction surface
