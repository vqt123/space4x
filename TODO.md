# Space4X - Development Roadmap & TODO

## Current Status âœ…

### Core Game Systems
- [x] Project setup (React + Vite + Three.js + TypeScript)
- [x] 3D universe with 500 randomly distributed trading ports
- [x] Center-focused camera system with scroll wheel zoom
- [x] Player ship implementation (blue cone with distinct appearance)
- [x] 10 intelligent AI trading bots with unique names
- [x] Visual travel lines showing destinations for all entities

### Trading Economy
- [x] Complete trading economy with profit calculations
- [x] Action points system (500 for player, 300-500 for bots)
- [x] Diminishing returns - port efficiency decreases after trading
- [x] Dynamic profit/action ratio calculations
- [x] Strategic decision making with cost/benefit analysis
- [x] Resource management and affordability checks

### User Interface
- [x] Trading terminal with current location and navigation options
- [x] Real-time leaderboard showing player vs bot rankings
- [x] Travel progress indicators and action point tracking
- [x] Efficiency percentage display for all trading options
- [x] Visual hierarchy with current port highlighting

### AI & Competition
- [x] Smart bot trading behavior with resource constraints
- [x] Bot strategic decision making based on action points
- [x] Competitive economy where bots affect port profitability
- [x] Live performance tracking and ranking system

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- [x] Fix trade button efficiency update issues
- [x] Fix bot position switching during player trades
- [x] Proper state synchronization across all entities
- [x] Port reference syncing for consistent game state

## Next Phase: Polish & Enhancement ðŸŽ¨

### Visual Improvements
- [ ] Add port names/labels visible in 3D space
- [ ] Visual indicators for high/low efficiency ports
- [ ] Particle effects for ship movement or trading
- [ ] Enhanced lighting and atmospheric effects
- [ ] Better visual distinction for player vs bot ships

### User Experience
- [ ] Sound effects for trading, travel, and notifications
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Game statistics and performance history
- [ ] Tutorial or onboarding for new players
- [ ] Settings panel for game customization

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Fix instanced mesh initialization for better port rendering
- [ ] Optimize 500 individual mesh components
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders and state updates
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for long gameplay sessions

### Game Features
- [ ] Different port types with specialized trading
- [ ] Ship upgrades (speed, cargo capacity, efficiency)
- [ ] Random events affecting port profitability
- [ ] Achievements and progression system
- [ ] Save/load game state

## Code Quality Improvements ðŸ“‹

### Architecture
- [ ] Extract game logic into separate utility files
- [ ] Separate UI components into individual files
- [ ] Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Integration tests for trading system
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Code documentation and comments

## Technical Debt ðŸ”§

### Known Issues
- Individual mesh rendering for 500 ports (performance concern)
- Large single file structure (maintainability)
- Missing error handling for edge cases

### Future Considerations
- WebGL performance optimization
- Scalability for larger universes
- Multiplayer architecture preparation
- Mobile device compatibility

## Development Guidelines

- Maintain 60fps performance target
- Keep first-minute experience engaging and clear
- Preserve competitive balance between player and bots
- Ensure all UI information is immediately actionable
- Test trading economy balance regularly
